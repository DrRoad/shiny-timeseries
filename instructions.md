# How can I use the Time Series Explorer?
This application creates standard time series graphs from compatible data sets
on our data catalogue.

Get started:

* Choose a dataset, choose the CSV resource, and inspect / preview the data.
* Pick a numeric variable for the y axis, and a date variable for the x axis.
* View the graph in the "visualise" tab, modify graphical parameters.
* Download the graph as PDF, plus the R code to reproduce the graph as text.
* Coming soon: paste your API key to upload the PDF graph and R code back to the data catalogue.
